"""The next few days, in one or two lines of plain Thai — not a table.

Poom asked (2026-09-23) for the outlook as something read at a glance: "2-3 วัน
นี้ฝนตกบ่ายๆ อุณหภูมิใกล้เคียงเดิม". This writes that sentence from the same
Open-Meteo reading the card shows (ECMWF, see dashboard.WEATHER_URL), with
fixed rules rather than a model: the words must be the same every time for the
same numbers, and a sentence costs nothing to write here.

THE RULES, over the next THREE days (tomorrow and the two after):
  rain     a day "has rain" at >= 50% chance or >= 2 mm. 0 days: "ไม่ค่อยมีฝน";
           1-2: "มีฝนบางวัน"; 3: "ฝนตกเกือบทุกวัน".
  when     the part of the day with the highest average chance of rain across
           those days — เช้า 06-12, บ่าย 12-18, ค่ำ 18-24, กลางคืน 00-06 —
           said only when there is rain to say it about.
  heat     the average high of those days against today's high: 1.5 °C or more
           above is "ร้อนขึ้น", as much below is "เย็นลง", otherwise
           "อุณหภูมิใกล้เคียงเดิม".
Nothing usable, and there is no sentence (None), and the card goes without.
