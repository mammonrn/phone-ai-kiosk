"""`probe tmd` and `probe gistda`: call every documented endpoint a key
unlocks, ONCE each, sequentially, and print a summary a person (Poom) can
paste straight back into a chat — because it is built to never contain a
secret in the first place.

WHY THIS EXISTS: before wiring a new data source into the kiosk, the
question is "what does this key actually give us" — dataset names, field
names, how fresh the newest record is, how much of the country it covers.
Reading that off raw responses by hand means pasting JSON/XML that still has
the key in the URL that produced it. This module calls each endpoint once,
throws away the URL and the key, and prints only what is safe: dataset name,
HTTP status, field names, one or two SHORT sample rows with personal-looking
fields stripped, freshness (the newest timestamp found), coverage (record
count / bbox / province count), and bytes read.

NEVER PRINTED, BY CONSTRUCTION:
  * the key itself, in any form (plain, URL-encoded);
  * any URL that carries a query string (only the path is ever printed);
  * request headers (NWP's Bearer token travels this way; GISTDA's own key
    never does — see the GISTDA section below — but one GISTDA endpoint,
    drought-recurrence, needs a non-secret `Referer` header, also never
    printed, just in case a future endpoint ever puts something sensitive
    there too);
  * an error body or exception message that might echo the request URL back
    (`redact()` scrubs every configured secret value out of everything this
    module prints, including exception text, before it reaches `out`).

NO KEY, NO REQUEST: exactly like dams.py, a probe with a missing key prints
which key is missing and exits non-zero without making any request at all.

ONE CALL PER ENDPOINT, WITH A PAUSE: this is a diagnostic tool run by hand
occasionally, not a background refresh — hammering a free government API
during a probe would be the wrong way to ask "what do you have".
`PAUSE_SECONDS` between calls is deliberately generous.

#: publishes on those two dataset pages (live "ลองใช้งาน" example URLs —
#: never Poom's own key, never written to a file); full findings in
#: docs/research/gistda-fields.md, summary here:
#:   * `bbox` DOES filter server-side (proof: a small box over Chiang Rai
#:     returned 0 features, the same box moved to Ayutthaya returned 43,
#:     numberMatched matched numberReturned in both cases) — the "bbox

#:     this probe's OWN `_BANGKOK_BBOX` being ~155 km tall and quietly
#:     including Ayutthaya, not a server-side bug; shrunk below.
#:   * `pv_idn`/`ap_idn`/`tb_idn` (province/district/subdistrict — matching
#:     provinces.json's own 2-digit codes for `pv_idn`, confirmed: pv_idn=14
#:     landed on "จ.พระนครศรีอยุธยา") filter server-side too, independent of
#:     `bbox` — either alone, or combined (an AND).
#:   * `limit` is honoured up to at least 5000 in ONE page (no server-side
#:     cap seen below that) — GISTDA_PAGE_LIMIT below (200) is this probe's
#:     own politeness choice, not a server minimum.
#:   * `sort=asc`/`sort=desc` made no difference to feature order in a live
#:     test — do not rely on it.
#:   * NO field-selection/geometry-skipping parameter exists: an unknown
#:     query parameter (tried: `properties=`, `select=`, `fields=`,
#:     `skipGeometry=`, `geometry=false`) is silently treated as an
#:     impossible extra filter — the response comes back 200 with
#:     numberMatched=0, not an error and not "ignored". Never add a
#:     speculative parameter to a live request; it looks like "no data
#:     here", not "bad request".
#:   * real `properties` field names (flood/1day, confirmed by a live probe,
#:     never `img_date`/`date` as originally guessed): pv_idn/pv_tn,
#:     ap_idn/ap_tn, tb_idn/tb_tn, lat/long, `file_name` (the source image
#:     id(s), comma-joined, each ending in an embedded YYYYMMDD_HHMM —
#:     THIS is the freshness signal, not `_createdAt`/`_updatedAt` which are
#:     only GISTDA's own database write time, clustered at probe time
#:     regardless of the window asked for), `flood_area` (rai, confirmed by
#:     unit cross-check — see docs/research/gistda-fields.md — duplicated
#:     across every parcel feature in the same tb_idn, i.e. a per-SUBDISTRICT
#:     rollup, not per-feature), and several per-PARCEL crop-area fields in
#:     m² (`_area`/`f_area`/`rice_area`/`cassava_area`/`maize_area`/
#:     `sugarcane_area`) plus building/hospital/school/population counts.
#:     flood-freq's own schema instead carries `area_rai` (per-pixel, rai),
#:     `shape_area` (the same pixel, m² — area_rai*1600 ≈ shape_area,
#:     confirming the unit), `freq` (count of `y_2011`..`y_2024` flagged 1)
#:     — genuinely one tiny (~0.02 rai) polygon per pixel: one district
#:     alone (Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya) answered 12,829 of them, which is
#:     why a whole-country crawl belongs to tools/build_flood_freq.py, run
#:     once on the VPS with Poom's own key, not this probe.
#:   * `gi-service` endpoints (drought-recurrence) are a DIFFERENT API
#:     family: a plain JSON array (no `features`/`links` wrapper, no
#:     pagination), pre-aggregated per subdistrict, and 403
#:     "REFERER_REQUIRED" without a `Referer` header naming the dataset
#:     page — see `extra_headers` below.
#: A SEPARATE STAC catalogue for the same flood datasets
#: (`/api/2.0/resources/stac/flood/...`) instead documents a `token=`
#: parameter; whether that is the SAME value as `api_key` was not confirmed
#: (Poom's own sign-up confirmation may say — worth checking), so the STAC
#: and WMS/WMTS/TMS map-tile forms are left out of this probe: tiles are
#: images, not the field/freshness/coverage summary this tool exists to
#: print, and a wrong guess at `token` would just be noise (see the
